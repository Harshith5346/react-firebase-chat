Deploy-a-Chat-Application
Task is to build a real time chat application in Node JS and deploy it on Google Cloud.

Objectives

Users should be able to go to a link and view your chat app.
They should be able to "sign in with Google" to access their account.
After signing in, they should be able to:
initiate chats with other users' accounts based on the contacts' registration email send chats to other users view previous chats Front-end

The front-end is up to you. You may use a template or prebuilt repository to make this step simple, but you're also welcome to demonstrate your front-end skills through building something custom. All you need is a side bar where users can select who they are messaging and a chat interface for each conversation.

Back-end & Deployment

Google Cloud - Setup a free Google Cloud account to deploy your application.
Authentication - You should use Firebase for authentication. You shoud only offer "sign in with Google", so do not build any other kinds of auth.
Database - Use Google's Cloud SQL to store the conversations that users have.
Deployment - Use Firebase to host the website and run the NodeJS backend.
